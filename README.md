# TFC Agent Kubernetes

Deploys a Terraform Cloud Agent on an existing Kubernetes cluster. This agent
can be used to connect to and manager private resources with Terraform (i.e. 
connecting to our database directly from Terraform with the Postgresql 
provider).

## Usage

```hcl
provider "kubernetes" {
  # Context to choose from the config file, if needed.
  config_context = "example-context"
  version        = "~> 1.12"
}

module "tfc_agent" {
  source = "https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-kubernetes-tfc-cloud-agent.git?ref=master"

  # Your agent token generated in Terraform Cloud
  token       = var.tfc_agent_token
  namespace   = var.namespace
  stage       = var.stage
  environment = var.environment
  name        = var.name

  # You can specify a namespace other than "default"
  kubernetes_namespace = "tfc-agent"
}
```
